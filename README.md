# Backend Team 9

Put skills to the test in a productive environment very similar to that of a technology company.

We decided to deploy our REST API at https://render.com/. This allows us to quickly deploy our product, we try to follow a pepline using github actions in order to do continuous deployment.

The workflow was made up as follows:
- [x]  Fork the repository
- [x]  Clone repository locally
- [x]  Create new branch. Example (feat/apianddbconection)
- [x]  make changes to it
- [x]  Push to the contributor's repository
- [x]  Request Poll Request using industry standards.
- [x]  User with high knowledge approves Merge and the REST API is deployed
